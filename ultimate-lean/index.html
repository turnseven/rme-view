                <h3>*GENERALLY EXPECTED RESULTS FROM OUR 14 DAY METABOLISM RESET, BODY SCULPTING SEQUENCE AND RADIANT ME SITE AND COMMUNITY:</h3>
                <p>Although our products are intended to be fully implemented, and we work hard to ensure it's easy to do so, the typical user of virtually all education products treats them in much the same way they treat a book. The vast majority read
                    or skim through it once, then do not implement the program or take any recommended action based. The results of our exercise methodology are intangible, and not measured in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive
                    results of any kind. And even when consumers implement our product in full, more often than not they do not report increases in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive results of any kind. Reports of specific
                    fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or any positive results of any kind should therefore be understood as the exception rather than the rule. Consumers who use our products can generally expect not to see any increase in fat
                    loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or positive results of any kind. It is entirely possible you will gain fat, lose muscle, lose abdominal definition, and experience other negative outcomes as a result of the advice contained
                    in our products.</p>
                <h3>*TESTIMONIALS DISCLAIMER:</h3>
                <p>Testimonials from radiant.me, community.radiant.me and/or from MarinaSantosFit are unverified results that have been forwarded to us by users of the Radiant Me programs, and may not reflect the typical purchaser's experience (as are described
                    above,) may not apply to the average person and are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results. If we have disclosed typical results based on information provided to us by a manufacturer
                    or other reputable third party source, you should presume that the typical results as stated are more reliable than the testimonials and other examples found at radiant.me, community.radiant.me and/or from MarinaSantosFit. However,
                    you should always perform due diligence and not take such results at face value. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in typical results information supplied to us by manufacturers or other reputable third parties. If
                    a product or service is new, you understand that it may not have been available for purchase long enough to provide an accurate results history. Again, it is possible that even with perfect use of the program, you will not achieve
                    the results described in testimonials. They are meant to be a showcase of the best results the program has produced, and should not be taken as the results a typical user will get.</p>
                <h3>*RISKS OF PRODUCT USE:</h3>
                <p>The website’s content is not a substitute for direct, personal, professional medical care and diagnosis. None of the diet plans or exercises (including products and services) mentioned at radiant.me, community.radiant.me and/or from MarinaSantosFit
                    should be performed or otherwise used without clearance from your physician or health care provider. The information contained within is not intended to provide specific physical or mental health advice, or any other advice whatsoever,
                    for any individual and should not be relied upon in that regard. We are not medical professionals and nothing on this website should be misconstrued to mean otherwise.</p>
                <p>There may be risks associated with participating in activities mentioned on radiant.me, community.radiant.me and/or from MarinaSantosFit for people in poor health or with pre-existing physical or mental health conditions. Because these
                    risks exist, you will not participate in such diet plans if you are in poor health or have a pre-existing mental or physical condition. If you choose to participate in these risks, you do so of your own free will and accord, knowingly
                    and voluntarily assuming all risks associated with such dietary activities. These risks may also exist for those who are currently in good health right now.</p>

                                    <p>IF (intermittent fasting) is a <em>fabulous</em> method to <b>“trick” your metabolism into running faster… dropping more weight… and boosting your energy at the same time!</b> It’s anti-inflammatory, it’s great for your blood sugar, and it’s the protocol that <u>I personally follow most days.</u></p>
                                    <p>Once my body adapted to it, I never wanted to go back (except, of course, during pregnancy!)</p>
                                    <p>So in this guide, you’ll get a <b><em>step-by-step</em> blueprint to transition to IF</b>. It comes in at 67 pages, and it covers <em>everything</em>. I’ll give you multiple fasting protocols to try… I’ll tell you how to combine it with your workouts… and I’ll lay out the “get started” plan to ease the transition.</p>
