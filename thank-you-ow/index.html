                    SERIES AND RADIANT ME SITE AND COMMUNITY:</h3>
                    <p>Although our products are intended to be fully implemented, and we work hard to ensure it's easy to
                        do so, the typical user of virtually all education products treats them in much the same way they
                        treat a book. The vast majority read or skim through it once, then do not implement the program or
                        take any recommended action based. The results of our exercise methodology are intangible, and not
                        measured in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive results of any kind. And
                        even when consumers implement our product in full, more often than not they do not report increases
                        in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive results of any kind. Reports of
                        specific fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or any positive results of any kind should
                        therefore be understood as the exception rather than the rule. Consumers who use our products can
                        generally expect not to see any increase in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or positive
                        results of any kind. It is entirely possible you will gain fat, lose muscle, lose abdominal
                        definition, and experience other negative outcomes as a result of the advice contained in our
                        products.</p>
                    <h3>*TESTIMONIALS DISCLAIMER:</h3>
                    <p>Testimonials from radiant.me, community.radiant.me and/or from MarinaSantosFit are unverified results
                        that have been forwarded to us by users of the Radianet Me programs, and may not reflect the typical
                        purchaser's experience (as are described above,) may not apply to the average person and are not
                        intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results. If we have
                        disclosed typical results based on information provided to us by a manufacturer or other reputable
                        third party source, you should presume that the typical results as stated are more reliable than the
                        testimonials and other examples found at radiant.me, community.radiant.me and/or from
                        MarinaSantosFit. However, you should always perform due diligence and not take such results at face
                        value. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in typical results information supplied to
                        us by manufacturers or other reputable third parties. If a product or service is new, you understand
                        that it may not have been available for purchase long enough to provide an accurate results history.
                        Again, it is possible that even with perfect use of the program, you will not achieve the results
                        described in testimonials. They are meant to be a showcase of the best results the program has
                        produced, and should not be taken as the results a typical user will get.</p>
                    <h3>*RISKS OF PRODUCT USE:</h3>

                        diagnosis. None of the diet plans or exercises (including products and services) mentioned at
                        radiant.me, community.radiant.me and/or from MarinaSantosFit should be performed or otherwise used
                        without clearance from your physician or health care provider. The information contained within is
                        not intended to provide specific physical or mental health advice, or any other advice whatsoever,
                        for any individual and should not be relied upon in that regard. We are not medical professionals
                        and nothing on this website should be misconstrued to mean otherwise.</p>
                    <p>There may be risks associated with participating in activities mentioned on radiant.me,

                        physical or mental health conditions. Because these risks exist, you will not participate in such
                        diet plans if you are in poor health or have a pre-existing mental or physical condition. If you
                        choose to participate in these risks, you do so of your own free will and accord, knowingly and
                        voluntarily assuming all risks associated with such dietary activities. These risks may also exist
                        for those who are currently in good health right now.</p></div>
